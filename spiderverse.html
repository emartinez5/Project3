    <h2>What is the Spiderverse?</h2>
      <p>The spiderverse is a culmination of all spiderman-esque characters coming together through the multiverse. 
      They come together originally in the comics to defeat a common threat. In newer media, it follows a similar 
      storyline. The spiderverse spans across various media forms including movies, video games, comics, and more!</p>

    <h2>Different Variants of Spidey</h2>
      <h3>Peter Parker</h3>
      <img class="floatleft" src="images/peteSpider.jpg" alt="Peter Parker unmasked in his spider suit thinking">
	    <p>Sometimes student, sometimes scientist and sometimes photographer, Peter Parker is a full-time super hero 
	    better known as the web-slinging and wall-crawling Spider-Man. As an orphaned child, Peter was raised by his 
	    Uncle Ben and Aunt May. At a science expo, Peter was bitten by an errant radioactive spider which granted 
	    him an array of arachnid powers.</p>
      <h3 class="clearme">Miles Morales</h3>
      <img class="floatleft" src="images/milesSpider.jpg" alt="Miles Morales in Spiderman suit in action landing pose">
        <p>In Miles' original reality, Norman Osborn, AKA the Green Goblin, seeks to recreate the circumstances that had created his arch 
	        nemesis Peter Parker, AKA Spider-Man. In his efforts at Oscorp, a genetically enhanced spider known as specimen 42 is unknowingly 
		stolen by the high-tech thief and Miles’ uncle Aaron Davis, AKA Prowler. Miles has a relationship with his uncle, one Miles' parents, 
		Jefferson Davis and Rio Morales, neither approved nor were aware of due to his life of crime. One day, while visiting his uncle to tell him 
		about winning a lottery to enroll at the prestigious Brooklyn Visions Academy, Miles suffers a bite by the burglarized spider. Upon 
		discovering that the bite endows him with superhuman abilities, Miles has a brief early brush with super-heroics when saving people from 
		a burning building. After talking things over with his close confidante Ganke Lee, however, Miles decides that this life wasn't for him. 
		Later, Miles sneaks out of school to watch the Green Goblin and Spider-Man have their climactic battle, which sees both of them perish 
		at the other's hand. Blaming himself for not using his powers to help Peter, Miles attends his funeral, where Gwen Stacy relays Uncle Ben's 
		lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. Initially, he’s inspired to fight crime in a makeshift Halloween costume version of 
		the Spider-Man outfit, but when he proves himself to S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Jessica Drew, AKA Spider-Woman, the agency gifts him a new uniform, 
		thus beginning his official career as the new Spider-Man.</p>
      <h3 class="clearme">Miguel O'hara</h3>
      <img class="floatleft" src="images/miguelSpider.jpg" alt="Miguel O'hara in Spiderman suit flying through the air with lightning in the background">
        <p>Miguel O'Hara, an engineer of Irish and Mexican descent, was born after his mother Conchata had an affair with her 
	    husband's boss Tyler Stone, though grew up believing his stepfather was also his biological father. 
	    As an adult, he worked for Alchemax. He was less than pleased at the corporation's vast control over the city. A 
	    genius in the field of genetics, he was being pressured by Tyler Stone to test a process to imprint genetic codes into 
	    human physiology. He reluctantly tried the process on a test subject named Mr. Sims. It was a failure - Sims was transformed 
	    into a hideous creature and quickly died. This was the last straw for Miguel: he went to Stone and attempted to hand in his 
	    notice. Stone gave and Miguel accepted a drink which, unknown to Miguel had been laced with the highly addictive 
	    hallucinogenic drug that bonds to the victim's DNA, called Rapture. As Alchemax was sole manufacturer of the drug, 
	    Stone expected that Miguel would be forced to remain with the company. In an attempt to rid himself of the hallucinogen, 
	    Miguel decided to try the genetic procedure, which had killed Sims, on himself, as he had input his own original genetic 
	    code as a baseline. The process was sabotaged by his supervisor, Aaron Delgato, in the attempt to kill him (the incident 
	    would be covered up as an accident). Miguel survived the process; his DNA was spliced with the genes of a spider and gained 
	    several powers, though he lost his addiction to Rapture.</p>
      <h3 class="clearme">Cindy Moon</h3>
      <img class="floatleft" src="images/silkSpider.jpg" alt="Cindy Moon in spiderwoman suit quickly evading debris">
        <p>As a child, her parents found out that Cindy had an eidetic memory. Her mother wanted her to focus on her studies 
	    while Cindy would rather continue playing on her school hockey team with her secret boyfriend, Hector Cervantez. When 
	    her mother found out, she was forced to go to the school field trip to General Techtronics and Cin told her she hated 
	    her. Sometime later, Cindy broke up with Hector since he was going to Boston College and she was going to Oxford 
	    University.When attending a public exhibition demonstrating the safe handling of nuclear laboratory waste materials, 
	    a spider irradiated by a particle accelerator used in the demonstration bit Peter Parker on the hand and fell from 
	    his hand, it then bit Cindy on her ankle before dying.</p>
      <h3 class="clearme">Jessica Drew</h3>
      <img class="floatleft" src="images/jessicaSpider.png" alt="Jessica Drew in Spiderwoman suit falling with leaves around her">
        <p>Born in 1924, Jessica Drew traveled with her parents, Jonathan and Miriam, to Mount Wundagore, in the small
	    Balkan nation of Transia. There, Jonathan conducted genetics research with Dr. Herbert Wyndham, who would later 
	    become the armored man-god known as the High Evolutionary. At seven years old, Jessica contracted uranium 
	    poisoning from her father’s work, but Jonathan and Wyndham saved her life through a spider-derived serum and 
	    years of hibernation in a genetic accelerator. Jessica spent decades in stasis, receiving subliminal education 
	    via special tapes. When she was finally awakened, she was cured, and had aged only to her early teens. She also 
	    discovered that she now possessed super human powers—a result of the combination of the radiation exposure and 
	    the spider-serum.</p>
